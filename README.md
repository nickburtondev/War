# War
This is a course project I built as part of The Complete Python Bootcamp, which simulates the War card game. The random module shuffles the deck, card values are stored in tuples, and classes create a deck of cards for two players.  Gameplay rounds are printed to the display until a player runs out of cards and is unable to declare war. Code formatted with Black.
